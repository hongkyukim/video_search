Motives: restore faith in America, to cut government spending, shorten the debt, and strengthen American values Cons - Less likable among kids and the working class, Mormon faith Obama: \"Pros\" - \"Charismatic\" speeches, professional campaigner, good at brainwashing and deceiving unintelligent, immature voters Cons: Un-American figure, dishonest politics, liar, hypocrite, makes false promises, supports legalizing homosexual marriage, bigger government, pro-countless debt, insincere change, pro-illegal immigration, socialist-minded, supports higher taxes not only against the rich, but on small businesses, advocate of racism (against Caucasians), black-white conflicts, class-warfare, and wants a dead, divided America, etc... Your choice... (but I say NOBAMA!

So little time, so much to redistribute.\" Romney also jabbed at Obama's running mate, saying he wished the president had brought Vice President Joe Biden \"because he'll laugh at anything.\" Referring to his \"Big Bird\" remarks in the first presidential debate, Romney delivered this zinger: \"In the spirit of Sesame Street, the president's remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter 'O' and the number 16 trillion.\""], ["duration", "00:10:34"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/HJrDz99rURA?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJrDz99rURA&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/HJrDz99rURA/default.jpg"], ["title", "Mitt Romney Roasts Obama, Media at Annual Al Smith Dinner 'So Little Time,So Much to Redistribute'"], ["updated_at", Sun, 21 Oct 2012 02:45:05 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "HJrDz99rURA"]]

President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney peeled off the stump Thursday to attend the annual Al Smith Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. During presidential election years, the event brings the candidates to the same stage to trade barbs and self-deprecating zingers as the race enter its final weeks. The white-tie affair raises millions for the Gov. Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation and is organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York to benefit needy children. More than 1600 were scheduled to attend the dinner. The menu includes poached lobster tail and dark chocolate tropical fruit cadeau. Tickets start at $2500. The diocese hopes to raise $5 million in grants this year. Last year it gave out $2 million in grants. President Barack Obama also taped an episode of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" while he's in Manhattan. The show aired late yesterday. Comedy Central host Jon Stewart pressed Obama over the government's changing explanation about the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, according to the Associated Press. When Stewart suggested that even Obama would concede his administration's coordination and communication had not been \"optimal,\" Obama said: \"If four Americans get killed, it's not optimal.

President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney peeled off the stump Thursday to attend the annual Al Smith Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. During presidential election years, the event brings the candidates to the same stage to trade barbs and self-deprecating zingers as the race enter its final weeks. The white-tie affair raises millions for the Gov. Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation and is organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York to benefit needy children. More than 1600 were scheduled to attend the dinner. The menu includes poached lobster tail and dark chocolate tropical fruit cadeau. Tickets start at $2500. The diocese hopes to raise $5 million in grants this year. Last year it gave out $2 million in grants. President Barack Obama also taped an episode of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" while he's in Manhattan. The show aired late yesterday. Comedy Central host Jon Stewart pressed Obama over the government's changing explanation about the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, according to the Associated Press. When Stewart suggested that even Obama would concede his administration's coordination and communication had not been \"optimal,\" Obama said: \"If four Americans get killed, it's not optimal.

A fired-up Mr Obama - widely seen as having lost the first debate - came out swinging as they tangled over tax, the economy and foreign policy. But the former Massachusetts governor fought back aggressively, accusing his rival of a litany of failed promises and having a poor record to defend. The two men will meet for one final pre-election debate on 22 October. As he battles for a second term, the Democratic president is trying to hang on to narrow leads in many of the nine key swing states that are expected to decide who will win the White House. A new Gallup national poll released just hours before the debate began showed Mr Romney leading Mr Obama 50% to 46% among likely voters. Both men roamed the stage at the town-hall-style debate in New York, circling and frequently interrupting each other. The 90-minute debate at Hofstra University on Long Island was moderated by CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley, who sought to fact-check and occasionally interrupt the candidates. Mr Obama was much more assertive than during their first debate this month in Denver, Colorado, but Mr Romney more than held his own. In early exchanges Mr Obama alluded to his bailout of the auto industry, saying that his rival wanted to \"Let Detroit go bankrupt\". Mr Romney denied that he had wanted car manufacturers to go bust, and promoted a plan to create 12m jobs <b>...</b>"], ["duration", "00:14:34"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/VvJKzo-5AA8?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvJKzo-5AA8&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvJKzo-5AA8/default.jpg"], ["title", "Presidential Debate - Barack Obama Vs Mitt Romney Highlights"], ["updated_at", Sun, 21 Oct 2012 02:45:05 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "VvJKzo-5AA8"]]

The animal was eventually tranquillized. Please be warned... some of the images in this story are graphic. The trampled body of an elderly woman - one of three victims killed by a rampaging elephant. The animal was taking part in a religious festival in India's southern Kerala state when it ran amok. The enraged elephant tore through the grounds of the Kootalmanikyam temple, attacking anything that got in its way. Two more people were killed, including this man: trampled to death in just seconds. Vets eventually managed to tranquillize the animal.

Video by Topic Simple (www.topicsimple.com) Transcription So, if you have been paying attention to chatter on the internet these days, especially geeky chatter, you may have heard the term HTML5. Well what is that? HTML stands for, uhhh forget it, but its the behind the scenes coding language that makes us able to see stuff online. Since the original HTML was invented with the web over 20 years ago, it has gone through many updates, but its been more than a decade since the last one, and in web terms that's pretty much forever. I mean like 10 years ago we all still loved our digital watches. So HTML has been a few steps behind changes on the web for quite some time. For example, when video came along, there was no way to integrate it naturally into HTML, so different companies developed their own video players to work around it. These worked OK, but they all were all external plugins, meaning that you had to download them, and this was, well, annoying and potentially risky. HTML5 is adding capabilities to deal with this stuff - like video - right into its code, so that plugins hopefully won't be necessary. And there's plans to add a bunch more cool stuff that previously was tricky or even impossible to implement with HTML alone. The overall hope is that some day it will create a standard, consistent web experience across all devices and browsers. HTML5 is still being developed, and as of early 2012 isn't 100% finalized, but the browsers are <b>...</b>"], ["duration", "00:01:32"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/mzPxo7Y6JyA?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzPxo7Y6JyA&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzPxo7Y6JyA/default.jpg"], ["title", "What is HTML5?"], ["updated_at", Mon, 22 Oct 2012 19:38:35 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "mzPxo7Y6JyA"]]

PPT slides: assets.en.oreilly.com From the official conference description at www.oscon.com We deployed Hive at StumbleUpon early this year as a tool for mining our HBase production datasets. It has been quite a success with both engineering and our analysts; engineers no longer have to write the analysts' reports and the analysts don't have to deal with cranky engineers. In this presentation, we will first cover the reasons why someone would use Hive with HBase instead of directly using HDFS files, and which goals can be accomplished. We will then review how the Hive-HBase integration works to better understand the state and drawbacks of the current implementation. The second part will cover how we deployed Hive internally at StumbleUpon and how the data is fed into the system. This will include how we are live replicating the data from our MySQL and real-time HBase clusters into an analytical Hadoop/HBase cluster in a ETL fashion. We will also present some of our use cases and how they translate into the Hive query language. The presentation will end with our lessons learned and how we expect to grow our Hive usage as the company does. At the time of writing we are signing up more than 600000 new users per month and we just passed 15M total users."], ["duration", "00:33:43"], ["embedcode", "rtsp://v1.cache2.c.youtube.com/CkULENy73wIaPAlf_xCOeyGUWhMYDSANFEgGUgZ2aWRlb3NyIQEn1O1GlZktfORl3UKB23SVDvPB7EI6RNWvHdRsUJxg5gw=/0/0/0/video.3gp"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQhe44Q_18&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WpQhe44Q_18/default.jpg"], ["title", "HBase and Hive at StumbleUpon"], ["updated_at", Sat, 27 Oct 2012 03:12:02 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "WpQhe44Q_18"]]

Best of all, you can write Storm topologies using any programming language. Storm was open-sourced by Twitter in September of 2011 and has since been adopted by many companies around the world.

Storm makes it easy to write and scale complex realtime computations on a cluster of computers, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm guarantees that every message will be processed. And it's fast — you can process millions of messages per second with a small cluster. Best of all, you can write Storm topologies using any programming language. Storm was open-sourced by Twitter in September of 2011 and has since been adopted by many companies around the world. Storm has a wide range of use cases, from stream processing to continuous computation to distributed RPC.

You can use Mesos to run Hadoop, MPI, Hypertable, Spark (a new framework for low-latency interactive and iterative jobs), and others on the same cluster. You can also use Mesos to help build novel distributed applications and frameworks. In this talk I'll discuss the architecture and motivation of Mesos, describe how to build a new application/framework on Mesos, and how Mesos is currently being used at Twitter and other places. About Ben Hindman Benjamin Hindman is one of the creators of Mesos, a platform for building and running distributed systems. He has done research in the areas of programming languages and distributed systems as a graduate student at Berkeley, where he hopes to one day finish his PhD. These days he spends most of his time hacking on Mesos at Twitter where it is being used in production. www.airbnb.com"], ["duration", "01:00:14"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/Hal00g8o1iY?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hal00g8o1iY&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hal00g8o1iY/default.jpg"], ["title", "Airbnb: Tech Talk - Ben Hindman - 3/28/2012"], ["updated_at", Sun, 28 Oct 2012 01:39:57 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "Hal00g8o1iY"]]

Yet increasing numbers of North Koreans dare to flee. They go first to neighboring China, which rejects them as criminals, then on to Southeast Asia or Mongolia, and finally to South Korea, the United States, and other free countries. They travel along a secret route known as the new underground railroad. Melanie Kirkpatrick tells the harrowing story of the North Koreans' quest for liberty. Travelers on the new underground railroad include women bound to Chinese men who purchased them as brides, defectors carrying state secrets, and POWS from the Korean War held captive in the North for more than half a century. Their conductors are brokers who are in it for the money as well as Christians who are in it to serve God.

Then Shekhar meets with Meena and both fall in love with each. Their marriage cannot take place as Meena's father, Gokuldas, had killed Shekhar's dad. But when Mohan kills Gokuldas, the past is forgiven and the couple are allowed to get married. The marriage ceremony is marred with the appearance of the tiger, which runs away after being chased by a rifle-toting Shekhar. After about a year Meena gives birth to Raju but the tiger continues to be at large. When the tiger breaks into Shekhar's mansion, a frantic Shekhar decides to not return home until he kills it. He sets up a bait but the tiger refuses to fall for it. While Shekhar is waiting for the tiger to take the bait, it attacks and kills estate workers, compelling Shekhar to seek a human bait. When no one volunteers, Shekhar takes the matter into his own hands and decides to use Raju as a live bait for this man-eater."], ["duration", "02:35:23"], ["embedcode", "rtsp://v6.cache4.c.youtube.com/CkULENy73wIaPAlaEwSFqBt6aBMYDSANFEgGUgZ2aWRlb3NyIQEn1O1GlZktfORl3UKB23SVDvPB7EI6RNWvHdRsUJxg5gw=/0/0/0/video.3gp"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHobqIUEE1o&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/aHobqIUEE1o/default.jpg"], ["title", "Jaanwar Aur Insaan"], ["updated_at", Tue, 30 Oct 2012 06:39:51 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "aHobqIUEE1o"]]

It allows organizations to improve utilization and to share data between parallel computing frameworks without replicating it to separate clusters. Mesos is built around two design elements: a fine-grained resource sharing model at the level of tasks within a job, and a distributed scheduling mechanism called resource offers that delegates scheduling decisions to the applications. Together, these elements let Mesos achieve high utilization, respond rapidly to workload changes, and cater to frameworks with diverse scheduling needs, while remaining simple, scalable and robust. Our results show that Mesos provides near-optimal data locality for parallel applications, recovers rapidly from failures, and can scale to 50000 nodes."], ["duration", "00:29:14"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/dB8IDu7g9Nc?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB8IDu7g9Nc&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dB8IDu7g9Nc/default.jpg"], ["title", "RAD Lab: MESOS"], ["updated_at", Sat, 03 Nov 2012 02:47:35 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "dB8IDu7g9Nc"]]

In this video, Alex Kent from Los Alamos National Lab presents: Cyber Security Defense Using HPC. Abstract: Adversaries in the cyber domain continue to escalate their use of more sophisticated attacks and associated detection countermeasures. As a result, the difficulty and complexity of finding such adversaries and their attacks increasingly challenges cyber defenders. Traditionally, high performance and parallel computing (HPC) has been a successful tool in tackling complex problems, particularly over large data sets. Yet it has only been recently that HPC has successfully impacted the cyber defense problem. This talk will introduce the cyber defense problem space and its escalating nature. Three key areas where HPC is making contemporary and tangible improvements to cyber defense will then be discussed: distributed data storage and query, streaming data analysis, and large-scale graph analysis. Each of these areas will include overviews of both research and operational systems currently at the Department of Energy national laboratories that are leveraging core HPC capabilities for improved cyber defense. In addition, the importance and use of both message passing (eg MPI) and map/reduce (eg Hadoop) approaches to parallel processing will be highlighted. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the critical importance of HPC in forward-looking cyber security defense and where future directions may lead.\""], ["duration", "00:25:24"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/14Lp3MPgrYM?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Lp3MPgrYM&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/14Lp3MPgrYM/default.jpg"], ["title", "Cyber Security Defense Using HPC"], ["updated_at", Sat, 03 Nov 2012 02:47:35 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "14Lp3MPgrYM"]]

He is also a committer on Apache Hadoop. He is funded by a Google PhD fellowship. Before joining Berkeley, Matei got his undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Abstract: MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in supporting large-scale data-intensive cluster applications. However, these systems are inefficient for applications that share data among multiple computation stages, including many machine learning algorithms, because they are based on an acyclic data flow model. We present Spark, a new cluster computing framework that extends the data flow model with a set of in-memory storage abstractions to efficiently support these applications. Spark outperforms Hadoop by up to 30x in iterative machine learning algorithms while retaining MapReduce's scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, Spark makes programming jobs easy by integrating into the Scala programming language. Finally, Spark's ability to load a dataset into memory and query it repeatedly makes it especially suitable for interactive analysis of big data. We have modified the Scala interpreter to make it <b>...</b>"], ["duration", "00:40:52"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/qLvLg-sqxKc?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLvLg-sqxKc&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLvLg-sqxKc/default.jpg"], ["title", "NIPS 2011 Big Learning - Algorithms, Systems, & Tools Workshop: Spark: In-Memory Cluster..."], ["updated_at", Sat, 03 Nov 2012 02:47:35 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "qLvLg-sqxKc"]]

Carlos has conducted research in (1) learning and control in large-scale structured environments; (2) distributed multiagent coordination; (3) robust, efficient and resource-aware algorithms for sensor networks; (4) sensor placement and tasking; (5) query specific probabilistic modeling. Abstract: Two years ago we introduced GraphLab to address the critical need for a high-level abstraction for large-scale graph structured computation in machine learning. Since then, we have implemented the abstraction on multicore and cloud systems, evaluated its performance on a wide range of applications, developed new ML algorithms, and fostered a growing community of users. Along the way, we have identified new challenges to the abstraction, our implementation, and the important task of fostering a community around a research project. However, one of the most interesting and important challenges we have encountered is large-scale distributed computation on natural power law graphs. To address the unique challenges posed by natural graphs, we introduce GraphLab 2, a fundamental redesign of the GraphLab abstraction which provides a much richer computational framework.

Watch the rest here! bit.ly bit.ly You could say that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il has two primary obsessions: maintaining nuclear weapons capability as a means of protecting his \"hermit kingdom,\" and thwarting pressure from outside forces like America and the rest of the industrialized world to open his country to modern things like electricity... and he's obsessed with film. He loves movies. It's rumored that he has one of the largest private film collections in the world. His favorite film is Gone with the Wind and his favorite actress is Elizabeth Taylor. He's a film collector and bona fide cinephile, but he's much more. He's everything really. He's a director, a producer, a financier, a costume maker, set designer, screenwriter, cameraman, sound engineer... and he's also a film theorist. His masterwork on aesthetics and practice is \"On the Art of Cinema\" (written and published in the early 1970s). In it he gives himself the humble title, \"Genius of the Cinema.\" He built an extensive film studio in Pyongyang and when he couldn't find someone to make his film he did what any self-respecting eternal leader and great president would do... he kidnapped one.
