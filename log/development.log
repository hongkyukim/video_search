    d: Note: we have been experiencing technical difficulties with the audio and video, so we apologize for the recordings quality. Storm makes it easy to write and scale complex realtime computations on a cluster of computers, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm guarantees that every message will be processed. And it's fast — you can process millions of messages per second with a small cluster. Best of all, you can write Storm topologies using any programming language. Storm was open-sourced by Twitter in September of 2011 and has since been adopted by many companies around the world. Storm has a wide range of use cases, from stream processing to continuous computation to distributed RPC. In this talk I'll introduce Storm and show how easy it is to use for realtime computation.

video: Andreas Weigend @WalmartLabs / First Retail: Big Data War Stories
    d: www.weigend.com - What is Big Data and why is it important? What are the sources of Big Data and who gets to profit from it? What are the tricks, tools and techniques that turn Engineers into Data Scientists. The Social Data Revolution is at the forefront of this discussion, working on the issues by taking a customer centric approach to how data can created, coaxed and combined to create mutual value for consumers and organizations. The Big Data War Stories Meetup held in February 2012 gathered experts from Business and Technology to be moderated by Andreas to tell their stories from the frontline. 8 Rules for Big Data from Andreas Weigend, Social Data Lab 1. Start with the problem, not with the data 2. Share data to get data 3. Align interests of all parties 4. Make it trivially easy for people to contribute, connect, collaborate 5. Base the equation of your business on customer centric metrics 6. Decompose the business into its "atoms" 7. Let people do what people are good at, and computers what computers are good at 8. Thou shalt not blame technology for barriers of institutions and society This conversation among real-life Big Data developers will be moderated by Dr. Andreas Weigend (www.weigend.com) who does happen to have a PhD in rocket science (ok, it's actually in physics). Dr. Andreas Weigend (Moderator) directs the Social Data Lab at Stanford University.

video: Airbnb: Tech Talk - Yehuda Katz - 5/2/2012
    d: It's Harder Than It Looks Last month, I started a kickstarter to make it easier to install Rails on OSX and get started developing Rails applications. The response was largely positive, and I met my funding goal rather quickly. On the flip side, a number of folks publicly asked why this project is necessary. Surely, they reasoned, it would not be very difficult to script a Rails installation. This sort of reasoning pervades the open source community, allowing apparent simplicity to drive inappropriately simplistic solutions. Worse, it implies that non-trivial solutions are "overengineering" the problem. Because open source solutions have historically leaked implementation complexity into the public API, some end developers have become wary of large solutions, often assuming that the simpler the solution, the better. As examples of this phenomenon, I will talk about some aspects of Tokaido (the Rails project) that are unexpectedly difficult, and also how the bundler project faced a similar reaction in some circles. I will also talk about how certain seemingly complex solutions lead to win-wins by eliminating sources of errors that are not limited to new developers. These kinds of solutions always require more work and more code than the simple solutions, but they are worth it. About Yehuda Katz Yehuda Katz is a member of the Ember.js, Ruby on Rails and jQuery Core Teams; he spends his daytime hours at the startup he founded, Tilde Inc..

Because open source solutions have historically leaked implementation complexity into the public API, some end developers have become wary of large solutions, often assuming that the simpler the solution, the better. As examples of this phenomenon, I will talk about some aspects of Tokaido (the Rails project) that are unexpectedly difficult, and also how the bundler project faced a similar reaction in some circles. I will also talk about how certain seemingly complex solutions lead to win-wins by eliminating sources of errors that are not limited to new developers. These kinds of solutions always require more work and more code than the simple solutions, but they are worth it.

video: PeepCode Screencast | Play by Play - Yehuda Katz Part 1 Rails 3
    d: Watch the entire screencast at peepcode.com This screencast is part of PeepCode's Play By Play series where we sit down with expert programmers and watch them work. The point isn't to create a deployable product, but rather to discover workflow tips and development hacks that usually require years of experience to figure out. Yehuda Katz is a committer to several top open source projects, including Ruby on Rails and jQuery. He's also driving development of Ember.js, a framework for creating "ambitious web applications." In this live session, he builds the backend for a scoring system using Rails 3. In about 80 minutes, he writes a prototype for retrieving data and serializing it for use on a client. You might remember this as the same task that fellow Rails committer Aaron Patterson tackled in a previous Play by Play. You'll have fun seeing two different approaches that top developers take to solve the same problem! This is an advanced screencast. We don't stop to explain what's happening (although Yehuda does talk about his thought process and workflow along the way). Topics covered include: - Rails 3 serializers - Vim - Debugging with Pry - Choosing an HTTP client In a separate video (Part 2), Yehuda builds an Ember.js front end to complete the application.

En este video comenzaremos a " ensuciarnos las manos ", es decir pondremos las manos en el código. Iniciamos el proceso de conocer la sintaxis del códido Ruby, y partiremos viendo cómo embeberlo dentro de nuestro HTML. Veremos la declaración de variables, la concatenación de string y la interpolación de valores. Aprenderemos a trabajar con condiciones y controles de flujo, específicamente if y when case ( then ). Veremos cómo llamar a funciones nativas de Ruby ya llamar a las propiedades de los objetos. Para eso último usaremos la función rand() y la propiedad length respectivamente. Todo en 59 minutos de charla.

video: Opening Ceremony Olympics 2012: London Packs in British Stuff
    d: SUBSCRIBE to Next Media Animation: www.youtube.com The Opening Ceremony of London's 2012 Olympic Games have been highly anticipated. Already, some secret details have been leaked to the public! Here is what we've pieced together. Facebook: www.facebook.com Webpage: www.nma.tv Twitter @nmatv: twitter.com Tumblr: nmatv.tumblr.com No matter how hard director Danny Boyle tried to keep things a secret (aka starting a #SavetheSurprise campaign on Twitter) details still leaked out. With around 62000 people involved in the ceremonies it's nearly impossible to keep it a secret. SPOILER ALERT: So here is what we know: There are going to be 30 Mary Poppins' fighting a 40-foot-tall Lord Voldemort. Makes sense, right? As if that wasn't bizarre enough, they will also have 100 children on hospital beds doing a synchronized dance to go along with the 'Isles of Wonder' theme. It is very obvious ceremony organizers are stuffing as many British references into the opening ceremonies as possible. We decided to take a crack at rounding out what will be included in the rest of the grand production. Check it out!

video: Chad Mairn on creating a web app with jQTouch - MSU Libraries Emerging Technologies Summit
    d: According to jqtouch.com, jQTouch is a "jQuery plugin for mobile Web development on the iPhone, Android, iPod Touch, and other forward-thinking devices." Web apps can easily be created using jQTouch, and they resemble native apps. jQTouch includes native WebKit animations, automatic navigation, extensions for geo-location and offline capabilities, and themes built specifically for mobile WebKit browsers like the above-mentioned mobile devices. In this session, Chad Mairn will explain the differences between native and Web apps, highlight some free and useful web development tools, and will then demonstrate how to install and customize jQTouch in order to help kick start your library's mobile Web presence. This is a presentation from the 2011 MSU Libraries Emerging Technologies Summit. For more information about the Summit, please visit library.msstate.edu
