    d: Note: we have been experiencing technical difficulties with the audio and video, so we apologize for the recordings quality. Storm makes it easy to write and scale complex realtime computations on a cluster of computers, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm guarantees that every message will be processed. And it's fast — you can process millions of messages per second with a small cluster. Best of all, you can write Storm topologies using any programming language. Storm was open-sourced by Twitter in September of 2011 and has since been adopted by many companies around the world. Storm has a wide range of use cases, from stream processing to continuous computation to distributed RPC. In this talk I'll introduce Storm and show how easy it is to use for realtime computation.

video: Andreas Weigend @WalmartLabs / First Retail: Big Data War Stories
    d: www.weigend.com - What is Big Data and why is it important? What are the sources of Big Data and who gets to profit from it? What are the tricks, tools and techniques that turn Engineers into Data Scientists. The Social Data Revolution is at the forefront of this discussion, working on the issues by taking a customer centric approach to how data can created, coaxed and combined to create mutual value for consumers and organizations. The Big Data War Stories Meetup held in February 2012 gathered experts from Business and Technology to be moderated by Andreas to tell their stories from the frontline. 8 Rules for Big Data from Andreas Weigend, Social Data Lab 1. Start with the problem, not with the data 2. Share data to get data 3. Align interests of all parties 4. Make it trivially easy for people to contribute, connect, collaborate 5. Base the equation of your business on customer centric metrics 6. Decompose the business into its "atoms" 7. Let people do what people are good at, and computers what computers are good at 8. Thou shalt not blame technology for barriers of institutions and society This conversation among real-life Big Data developers will be moderated by Dr. Andreas Weigend (www.weigend.com) who does happen to have a PhD in rocket science (ok, it's actually in physics). Dr. Andreas Weigend (Moderator) directs the Social Data Lab at Stanford University.

video: Airbnb: Tech Talk - Yehuda Katz - 5/2/2012
    d: It's Harder Than It Looks Last month, I started a kickstarter to make it easier to install Rails on OSX and get started developing Rails applications. The response was largely positive, and I met my funding goal rather quickly. On the flip side, a number of folks publicly asked why this project is necessary. Surely, they reasoned, it would not be very difficult to script a Rails installation. This sort of reasoning pervades the open source community, allowing apparent simplicity to drive inappropriately simplistic solutions. Worse, it implies that non-trivial solutions are "overengineering" the problem. Because open source solutions have historically leaked implementation complexity into the public API, some end developers have become wary of large solutions, often assuming that the simpler the solution, the better. As examples of this phenomenon, I will talk about some aspects of Tokaido (the Rails project) that are unexpectedly difficult, and also how the bundler project faced a similar reaction in some circles. I will also talk about how certain seemingly complex solutions lead to win-wins by eliminating sources of errors that are not limited to new developers. These kinds of solutions always require more work and more code than the simple solutions, but they are worth it. About Yehuda Katz Yehuda Katz is a member of the Ember.js, Ruby on Rails and jQuery Core Teams; he spends his daytime hours at the startup he founded, Tilde Inc..

Because open source solutions have historically leaked implementation complexity into the public API, some end developers have become wary of large solutions, often assuming that the simpler the solution, the better. As examples of this phenomenon, I will talk about some aspects of Tokaido (the Rails project) that are unexpectedly difficult, and also how the bundler project faced a similar reaction in some circles. I will also talk about how certain seemingly complex solutions lead to win-wins by eliminating sources of errors that are not limited to new developers. These kinds of solutions always require more work and more code than the simple solutions, but they are worth it.

video: PeepCode Screencast | Play by Play - Yehuda Katz Part 1 Rails 3
    d: Watch the entire screencast at peepcode.com This screencast is part of PeepCode's Play By Play series where we sit down with expert programmers and watch them work. The point isn't to create a deployable product, but rather to discover workflow tips and development hacks that usually require years of experience to figure out. Yehuda Katz is a committer to several top open source projects, including Ruby on Rails and jQuery. He's also driving development of Ember.js, a framework for creating "ambitious web applications." In this live session, he builds the backend for a scoring system using Rails 3. In about 80 minutes, he writes a prototype for retrieving data and serializing it for use on a client. You might remember this as the same task that fellow Rails committer Aaron Patterson tackled in a previous Play by Play. You'll have fun seeing two different approaches that top developers take to solve the same problem! This is an advanced screencast. We don't stop to explain what's happening (although Yehuda does talk about his thought process and workflow along the way). Topics covered include: - Rails 3 serializers - Vim - Debugging with Pry - Choosing an HTTP client In a separate video (Part 2), Yehuda builds an Ember.js front end to complete the application.

En este video comenzaremos a " ensuciarnos las manos ", es decir pondremos las manos en el código. Iniciamos el proceso de conocer la sintaxis del códido Ruby, y partiremos viendo cómo embeberlo dentro de nuestro HTML. Veremos la declaración de variables, la concatenación de string y la interpolación de valores. Aprenderemos a trabajar con condiciones y controles de flujo, específicamente if y when case ( then ). Veremos cómo llamar a funciones nativas de Ruby ya llamar a las propiedades de los objetos. Para eso último usaremos la función rand() y la propiedad length respectivamente. Todo en 59 minutos de charla.

video: Opening Ceremony Olympics 2012: London Packs in British Stuff
    d: SUBSCRIBE to Next Media Animation: www.youtube.com The Opening Ceremony of London's 2012 Olympic Games have been highly anticipated. Already, some secret details have been leaked to the public! Here is what we've pieced together. Facebook: www.facebook.com Webpage: www.nma.tv Twitter @nmatv: twitter.com Tumblr: nmatv.tumblr.com No matter how hard director Danny Boyle tried to keep things a secret (aka starting a #SavetheSurprise campaign on Twitter) details still leaked out. With around 62000 people involved in the ceremonies it's nearly impossible to keep it a secret. SPOILER ALERT: So here is what we know: There are going to be 30 Mary Poppins' fighting a 40-foot-tall Lord Voldemort. Makes sense, right? As if that wasn't bizarre enough, they will also have 100 children on hospital beds doing a synchronized dance to go along with the 'Isles of Wonder' theme. It is very obvious ceremony organizers are stuffing as many British references into the opening ceremonies as possible. We decided to take a crack at rounding out what will be included in the rest of the grand production. Check it out!

video: Chad Mairn on creating a web app with jQTouch - MSU Libraries Emerging Technologies Summit
    d: According to jqtouch.com, jQTouch is a "jQuery plugin for mobile Web development on the iPhone, Android, iPod Touch, and other forward-thinking devices." Web apps can easily be created using jQTouch, and they resemble native apps. jQTouch includes native WebKit animations, automatic navigation, extensions for geo-location and offline capabilities, and themes built specifically for mobile WebKit browsers like the above-mentioned mobile devices. In this session, Chad Mairn will explain the differences between native and Web apps, highlight some free and useful web development tools, and will then demonstrate how to install and customize jQTouch in order to help kick start your library's mobile Web presence. This is a presentation from the 2011 MSU Libraries Emerging Technologies Summit. For more information about the Summit, please visit library.msstate.edu

video: Advanced jQueryMobile: changePage, pageInit, and Swipe
    d: It's time to start taking a more advanced look into jQuery Mobile and the jQuery Mobile API. In this screencast we will learn how to use the $.mobile.changePage, pageInit, and Swipe events. We will also use regular jQuery with jQuery Mobile to create a list element app that allows you to navigate by swiping on the list item you wish to open. Our entire app will be built using the APIs.

    d: The code is at: github.com The slides are at: www.slideshare.net Websites designed for smart phones are one of the fastest growing segments of the internet. JQuery Mobile makes it easy to create sites for mobile devices, but it is mostly about UI. It doesn't address the needs of an enterprise application. Things like how to load data from and persist data to the server, how to tie the JavaScript and HTML together, and minimize the amount of data transmitted. In this session I will show how to combine JQuery Mobile with Backbone.js and a ASP.NET MVC back-end. The end result is a website which is fast, efficient, and easier to enhance and maintain. Presented at Code Camp Fullerton 2012.

I was lucky enough to witness Mike and Darryl playing "cat and mouse" -- Darryl would hide behind the bushes and call to Mike, then move around the perimeter of the enclosure encouraging Mike to play. Mike obliged with hug and a kiss on the glass window behind which Darryl was hiding. I have never, ever seen a tiger in captivity react to a human in such a passionate, playful manner. taken from Mike VI = OMG home coming homecoming les miles, i am not happy right now, i know its not your fault COMPLETLEY - but take some of the blame les miles fired charlie weiss let go get les miles fired charlie weiss let go get loss mississippi ole miss MSU

video: Six Injured in Tiger Attack in Northern India
    d: At least six people are injured in a tiger attack in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state on Monday. The animal had strayed into a village in the Mathura district. After the attack, locals rushed to the fields to find the tiger. The tiger managed to attack four people all at once in the process. Later it attacked a child and the child's father. Many wild animals such as tigers, leopards and elephants have strayed into villages due to loss of habitat.

video: Lion Attack Friendly, Powerful, Dangerous
    d: The lion man enters a cage with big male lions. The Exotic Feline Rescue Center (EFRC) in western Indiana rescues abused cats and provides for them. The workers and volunteers do a tremendous service. This is a very dangerous activity. Joe has reared the lion from a baby and it knows him. Also shows several additional lion and tiger attacks. Shows their power and methods. They can instantly attack. Entering a lion cage takes bravery. **** The Lion (Panthera leo) is one of the four big cats and a member of the family Felidae. Some males can exceed 550 lb. Wild lions exist in Sub-Saharan Africa and a critically endangered remnant population lives in northwest India. Until about 10000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. Visually, the male lion is distinctive and is easily recognized by its mane. The face of the male, is one of the most widely recognized animal symbols in human culture as is its roar. **** White Lion The total number of white lions is unknown but the most recent count, in 2004, showed that only 30 were alive. White lions are Endangered. The one shown is one of Siegfried and Roys White Lions of Timbavati. Of only 30 white lions in the world, around seven are found in Ohio and this one is at the Cincinnati Zoo. *** The wildebeest, or gnu, can grow to 4 ft 10 in at the shoulder and weigh 265600 lb.

    d: Falk Köppe and Mateusz Sójka introduce themselves and the topic they want to present at Ruby Conferences. Abstract: As Ruby on Rails projects become larger and more complex, more local and remote services are needed by the applications. New teammates, unequal distribution of knowledge, keeping the setup documentation up-to-date, running the test infrastructure and many more problems can easily get out of control. Find out, how to successfully manage the chaos using real world solutions. We want to share our project experiences using an automated setup, heaps of Ruby tools, complex deployment scripts and the use of cloud services to save time, money and lots of headaches.

video: ETE 2012 - Adrian Holovaty - Pjax and the next generation of server-side Web frameworks
    d: Django co-creator Adrian Holovaty shares his ideas on the future of server-side Web frameworks. Are the current batch of frameworks getting long in the tooth? Should we really still be generating HTML from scratch on each page request? Can we automate some of the new best practices, such as Pjax? No Django knowledge is necessary to understand this talk; the thoughts apply equally to Ruby on Rails and other circa-2005 frameworks.

video: View Components in Rails by Harun Abbas Pathan
    d: There is definitely a need of lightweight view components in rails which are nothing but mini controllers and can be better fit to replace partials and filters. This talk is about Why do we need these lightweight components and details of Merb Parts, Rails Parts, Cells & Apotomo. For smaller applications Filter and Partials don't affect that much, but as the application grows, so your code-base too; then you start seeing just too many filters and partials. So we need a mechanism to serve the unrelated sections on main view using independent mini controllers.

video: Google I/O 2012 - Developing for a Global Audience: Tools for Localization and Internationalization
    d: C. Andrew Warren, Manish Bhargava As internet and mobile penetration continue to rise, developers face a unique and challenging opportunity: billions of new users speaking dozens of distinct languages. English has often been considered a lingua franca for apps and websites, but fewer than half of the current online population now speaks it - success in the global web will require a more nimble approach. This tech talk will explore some of the tips, tricks, and tools that can make internationalization (i18n) and localization (L10n) simpler for web and mobile app developers (with a focus on Chrome, Android, and App Engine apps).

video: 2012 Summer Olympics Preview: Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt, Beach Volleyball, Synchronized Swimming
    d: www.sbrforum.com Discussion of odds of Bolt or Blake to break the 100 meter world record at 5:39 A huge favorite in Synchronized Swimming discussed at 5:56 The 2012 Summer Olympics are finally here, and are sure to bring the same drama, controversy, intense competition, and quirky cast of characters as always. China and the US will battle it out at the two favorites for most gold medals, while major international stars like swimmer Michael Phelps and sprinter Usain Bolt will compete. Lesser-known stars such as legally-blind but still world-class archer Dong-Hyan Im will also get their day to shine, and as always, the more puzzling Olympics events such as Beach Volleyball and Synchronized Swimming will once again be on display, front and center. SBRForum.com personality Peter Loshak previews all of this and more, with betting lines and commentary. What do you think?

video: FOXTEL: This is London 2012 - Swimming
    d: Contently's third campaign of animations for FOXTEL, saw us tackle the Aussie superstars of the London 2012 Olympic Games. The brief was to create something different to the normal chest beating Olympic fare and equip FOXTEL's armchair experts with entertaining pub ammo. We're not sure what is the most gruelling event, the marathon, the 50km walk or getting jokes approved by the IOC, but we love doing these and we love working with the top geezers of Sixty40 on the animation. This campaign was devised to play across FOXTEL's on-air & social media channels.

video: Olympic Swimming Trials 2012 - Women's 200m Freestyle Finals (Allison Schmitt American Record)
    d: Allison Schmitt is establishing herself as a must-watch swimmer for the upcoming 2012 London Olympics. After winning the 400m freestyle on Tuesday, Schmitt continued her dominance Thursday by winning the 200m freestyle. Schmitt's winning time of 1:54.40 is a new American record, giving her another event she will compete in for the 2012 Olympics wearing the stars and stripes. In this event, the top six finishers qualify for the Olympic relay team, meaning Missy Frankin, Dana Vollmer, Lauren Perdue, Shannon Vreeland and Alyssa Anderson will be heading to London based on their finish in this event. With her second place finish in the 200m freestyle behind Schmitt, Franklin has also qualified for the individual race in London. Schmitt won a bronze medal during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing as part of the 4x200m freestyle relay team.

video: Unbelievable Top 10 Lion attacks on human [ HQ ]
    d: If you see a Big Cat nearby: - stare them in the eyes and don't look away. - shout, it can confuse them and break their concentration. - do not bend, crouch or crawl, cats like small targets. -do not run, it's a kind of attack trigger, and they can run much faster than humans.. - if there is warning growl from a mountain lion, shout and generally look as big as possible with your arms raised high. Throw sticks and rocks and shout abuse. They hate that. If they attack you: - fight back, unlike their more dangerous African cousins which are huge, the smaller mountain lion will usually take an adult human animal fairly seriously. Usually they hide and pounce or creep up on their victims, with the aim of biting the jugular and breaking the spine. Punch and grab for for their snouts and eyes, or testicles if it's a male. Shout and scream to confuse the critter, in addition to summoning help.

video: Top 11 lion attacks on People
    d: Latest lion attack around the world , 14/07/2012, updated weekly Zimbabwe man survives 'face to face' lion attack HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — A Zimbabwean state-run newspaper reports a farmer is recovering after surviving a lion attack in the remote northwest of the country. The Chronicle reported Saturday that a lioness pounced on farmer Joel Ngwenya near the Hwange nature preserve, goring his arms and upper body and leaving him unconscious. Lions had been preying on livestock in the district. "The lioness looked straight into my eyes, staring and roaring," Ngwenya told the paper from a hospital. It pinned him down with its claws and continued staring at him "face to face," he said. The lioness briefly moved away toward a lion cub then turned back on him. He regained consciousness, realizing "it just left me lying down and went away," the paper further quoted him as saying.

video: David Icke - The Manipulation Of Humanity (March 22, 2012)
    d: www.davidicke.com www.redicecreations.com British author David Icke has written 16 books and traveled to over 40 countries since 1990. His books reveal how a hidden hand is behind world-changing events like the attacks of 9/11 and the manufactured wars in the Middle East, as part of a mass mind manipulation technique he has dubbed problem-reaction-solution. While being controversial and often heavily attacked, David Icke has driven on with his unrelentless investigation into subject areas that others don't dare touch. He reveals information that has been kept from a "dumbed down" population and has allowed the establishment to treat them as nothing more than slaves to a sinister hidden agenda. David returns to Red Ice to talk about his newest book, Remember Who You Are. First, we begin the interview discussing Robert Green's campaign and ritualistic child abuse. Then, David speaks about reality within our holographic universe. Later, David gives his perspective on aliens manipulating human DNA. Lastly, we discuss archetypes as software programs. David explains how human emotion is tied to genetics and using consciousness to override manipulation from external sources.

video: Kiunjuri wants wildlife sanctuaries fenced
    d: www.ntv.co.ke Laikipia East Member of Parliament Mwangi Kiunjuri has blamed the internal Security Minister Professor George Saitoti for failing to contain human wildlife conflict in Laikipia. The MP says the Minister has failed in his responsibility to ensure wildlife sanctuaries are fenced off. Kiunjuri blames the Government for giving licenses to private developers who in turn do not fence their ranches leading to increased human wildlife conflict in the area. Laikipia Nature Conservancy has been on the spot following allegations that lions that attack people in the area are from there. Kiunjuri has given a one-week ultimatum to the conservancy's director Kuki Gullaman to fence it off or face the music. He was speaking in Laikipia where his lawyers collected more signatures to compel the Government to ensure all privately owned ranches are fenced with immediate effect.

video: Black Mamba vs Dead Lion 01, Deadly Snake Attacks Lion
    d: Ojatro.com http Africa's most feared snake, the elusive Black Mamba, holds the record for being the world's second longest venomous snake (after the king cobra), averaging around 10 feet in length, and sometimes growing to lengths of 15 feet. It is as well the fastest snake in the world, capable of moving at 10 - 12 mph (16--20 km/h). The Black Mamba is not named for the color of its body, which is usually a shade of grey. But for the highly pigmented interior of its mouth, which it shows at a threat display. Many people fear that the black mamba will actually chase and attack humans unprovoked, and there are evidences to support such concerns. Regardless, attacks on humans are surprisingly rare, more people die in Africa due to bites from cobras and other venomous snakes such as the puff adder. Black Mambas feed meanly on small mammal, reptiles and birds but it has been observed, that snakes sometimes prey on animals that are to large to devour. In this video I filmed how a hungry black mamba can across a dead lion. Without any hesitation, the mamba attacked the lifeless body of the lion, striking twice before trying to swallow the enormous carcass. Black Mamba vs Dead Lion, filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro in 2009.

video: Lion Meets Black Mamba 04, Time Lapse Speed x2
    d: Ojatro.com http Africa's most feared snake, the elusive Black Mamba, holds the record for being the world's second longest venomous snake (after the king cobra), averaging around 10 feet in length, and sometimes growing to lengths of 15 feet. It is as well the fastest snake in the world, capable of moving at 10 - 12 mph (16--20 km/h). The Black Mamba is not named for the color of its body, which is usually a shade of grey. But for the highly pigmented interior of its mouth, which it shows at a threat display. Many people fear that the black mamba will actually chase and attack humans unprovoked, and there are evidences to support such concerns. Regardless, attacks on humans are surprisingly rare, more people die in Africa due to bites from cobras and other venomous snakes such as the puff adder. Black Mambas feed meanly on small mammal, reptiles and birds but it has been observed, that snakes sometimes prey on animals that are to large to devour. In this video I filmed how a hungry black mamba can across a dead lion. Without any hesitation, the mamba attacked the lifeless body of the lion, striking twice before trying to swallow the enormous carcass.

video: Ryan Lochte the "Channing Tatum" of the Olympics?
    d: Bit.ly - Click to Subscribe! Facebook.com - Become a Fan! Twitter.com - Follow Us! Ryan Lochte might be dominating the 2012 London Olympics in the pool, but the star swimmer is stirring up buzz with female fans here in the states, who have so kindly dubbed him the Channing Tatum of the Olympics games! The stand-out athelete has managed to become this summer's sweetheart, and like actor Channing Tatum, he's constantly flashing a great smile and those rock hard abs. Lochte admits that he completely changed his diet for the 2012 games, and obviously it's working. As much as we see the Channing Tatum comparison, we're thinking that Ryan Lochte has a whole lot in common with another celebrity -- Lil Wayne! When the swimmer showed off his first 2012 Gold medal to photographers in London, the bling around his neck was outshined by the red, white and blue diamond-encrusted grill in him mouth. Sporting grills has become Lochte's trademark -- he's been photographed rocking the funky accessory dating all the way back to 2007. Let us know if you're a part of the Lochte nation by commenting below? And make sure to fill us in on whether or not you think Ryan Lochte really is the Channing Tatum of the Olympics. For more 411 from Hollywood, stick with us right here on ClevverTV. I'm Joslyn Davis -- thanks for watching! Hosted by: Joslyn Davis
