Motives: restore faith in America, to cut government spending, shorten the debt, and strengthen American values Cons - Less likable among kids and the working class, Mormon faith Obama: \"Pros\" - \"Charismatic\" speeches, professional campaigner, good at brainwashing and deceiving unintelligent, immature voters Cons: Un-American figure, dishonest politics, liar, hypocrite, makes false promises, supports legalizing homosexual marriage, bigger government, pro-countless debt, insincere change, pro-illegal immigration, socialist-minded, supports higher taxes not only against the rich, but on small businesses, advocate of racism (against Caucasians), black-white conflicts, class-warfare, and wants a dead, divided America, etc... Your choice... (but I say NOBAMA!

So little time, so much to redistribute.\" Romney also jabbed at Obama's running mate, saying he wished the president had brought Vice President Joe Biden \"because he'll laugh at anything.\" Referring to his \"Big Bird\" remarks in the first presidential debate, Romney delivered this zinger: \"In the spirit of Sesame Street, the president's remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter 'O' and the number 16 trillion.\""], ["duration", "00:10:34"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/HJrDz99rURA?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJrDz99rURA&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/HJrDz99rURA/default.jpg"], ["title", "Mitt Romney Roasts Obama, Media at Annual Al Smith Dinner 'So Little Time,So Much to Redistribute'"], ["updated_at", Sun, 21 Oct 2012 02:45:05 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "HJrDz99rURA"]]

President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney peeled off the stump Thursday to attend the annual Al Smith Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. During presidential election years, the event brings the candidates to the same stage to trade barbs and self-deprecating zingers as the race enter its final weeks. The white-tie affair raises millions for the Gov. Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation and is organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York to benefit needy children. More than 1600 were scheduled to attend the dinner. The menu includes poached lobster tail and dark chocolate tropical fruit cadeau. Tickets start at $2500. The diocese hopes to raise $5 million in grants this year. Last year it gave out $2 million in grants. President Barack Obama also taped an episode of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" while he's in Manhattan. The show aired late yesterday. Comedy Central host Jon Stewart pressed Obama over the government's changing explanation about the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, according to the Associated Press. When Stewart suggested that even Obama would concede his administration's coordination and communication had not been \"optimal,\" Obama said: \"If four Americans get killed, it's not optimal.

President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney peeled off the stump Thursday to attend the annual Al Smith Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. During presidential election years, the event brings the candidates to the same stage to trade barbs and self-deprecating zingers as the race enter its final weeks. The white-tie affair raises millions for the Gov. Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation and is organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York to benefit needy children. More than 1600 were scheduled to attend the dinner. The menu includes poached lobster tail and dark chocolate tropical fruit cadeau. Tickets start at $2500. The diocese hopes to raise $5 million in grants this year. Last year it gave out $2 million in grants. President Barack Obama also taped an episode of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" while he's in Manhattan. The show aired late yesterday. Comedy Central host Jon Stewart pressed Obama over the government's changing explanation about the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, according to the Associated Press. When Stewart suggested that even Obama would concede his administration's coordination and communication had not been \"optimal,\" Obama said: \"If four Americans get killed, it's not optimal.

A fired-up Mr Obama - widely seen as having lost the first debate - came out swinging as they tangled over tax, the economy and foreign policy. But the former Massachusetts governor fought back aggressively, accusing his rival of a litany of failed promises and having a poor record to defend. The two men will meet for one final pre-election debate on 22 October. As he battles for a second term, the Democratic president is trying to hang on to narrow leads in many of the nine key swing states that are expected to decide who will win the White House. A new Gallup national poll released just hours before the debate began showed Mr Romney leading Mr Obama 50% to 46% among likely voters. Both men roamed the stage at the town-hall-style debate in New York, circling and frequently interrupting each other. The 90-minute debate at Hofstra University on Long Island was moderated by CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley, who sought to fact-check and occasionally interrupt the candidates. Mr Obama was much more assertive than during their first debate this month in Denver, Colorado, but Mr Romney more than held his own. In early exchanges Mr Obama alluded to his bailout of the auto industry, saying that his rival wanted to \"Let Detroit go bankrupt\". Mr Romney denied that he had wanted car manufacturers to go bust, and promoted a plan to create 12m jobs <b>...</b>"], ["duration", "00:14:34"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/VvJKzo-5AA8?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvJKzo-5AA8&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvJKzo-5AA8/default.jpg"], ["title", "Presidential Debate - Barack Obama Vs Mitt Romney Highlights"], ["updated_at", Sun, 21 Oct 2012 02:45:05 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "VvJKzo-5AA8"]]

The animal was eventually tranquillized. Please be warned... some of the images in this story are graphic. The trampled body of an elderly woman - one of three victims killed by a rampaging elephant. The animal was taking part in a religious festival in India's southern Kerala state when it ran amok. The enraged elephant tore through the grounds of the Kootalmanikyam temple, attacking anything that got in its way. Two more people were killed, including this man: trampled to death in just seconds. Vets eventually managed to tranquillize the animal. Elephants often taken part in temple rituals, revered by Hindus as an incarnation of the elephant god Ganesh, hailed as the lord of luck and prosperity. It's not yet clear what provoked this particular elephant to go berserk.
