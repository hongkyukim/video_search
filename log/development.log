Issues include women&#39;s insecurity about their breasts (size, shape, measurements), different states (tanned, oiled, wet, bubbly), decorated (pierced, tattooed), motherhood (pregnant, suckled), and ultimately the possible loss (mastectomy). The images in this video will no doubt stir different feelings in each individual who views them. We hope this video will give you a greater appreciation of the many issues involving women&#39;s breasts.<br /><br />Please visit www.SHOPBreastCancer.com so that you can learn more about breast cancer and see how easily you can support the fight against breast cancer by using the SHOPBreastCancer link whenever you shop at Amazon.com."], ["duration", "00:00:00"], ["embedcode", "http://player.vimeo.com/video/280156"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", nil], ["linkurl", "http://vimeo.com/280156"], ["provider", "vimeo"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/210/005/21000545_200.jpg"], ["title", "Breasts Breasts Breasts"], ["updated_at", Mon, 15 Oct 2012 06:26:09 UTC +00:00], ["views", 69962], ["yt_video_id", "280156"]]

All, to his dismay ended in a failed note due to the resilience of a combined effort from the Sri Lankan security forces. The two LTTE improvised Czech manufactured Zlin-143 aircraft were brought down within an hour from its initial detection at Puthukkudiyirippu around 8.40pm, due to rapid and precision anti-air gun fire. The two LTTE craft were making a desperate flee, losing sight of the initially designated targets in total disarray under the flurry of anti-air attacks. Well coordinated communication, early detection and the preparedness of the forces paid off, denying LTTE what defence observers viewed as an abortive attempt to disrupt the prevailing normalcy in South, despite the continuation of military operations in Wanni.

Speaking to the Korean loggers as they take a cigarette break the picture is painted in even starker terms: \"What he's saying here is that the majority of workers have a ten-year plus labour commitment to live and work in the middle of nowhere for almost no pay.\" So why do they do it? As ever the North Korea propoganda machine is present to remind the workers of the 'home land' and the wise teachings of Kim Jong-Il and his father Kim Il Sung. A sign at the town reads: \"Kim Il Sung lives with us forever.\" Yet travelling into one of the strangest of North Korea's frontiers, it is clear that the hermit kingdom's isolationist tactics are not paying off in these camps.

Government minders picked us up at the airport and took us on what felt like the strangest four-day amusement park ride in the world. We arrived in the middle of Children's Week. Young Pioneers (similar to Hitler Youth) from all over the country flooded into Pyongyang for several days of fantastical public rallies, all seemingly meant to bolster the personality cult of their new leader, 28 year old Kim Jong Un. Propaganda vans drive through the city blasting cheery slogans. People all over Pyongyang walk with purpose, but you can never figure out where they're going. Most of the lights in the city go off at 11pm. They let you ride the Metro for one stop, but your fellow passengers may be actors. The rest of the Metro might not function. In short, nothing you see is verifiably real. It's a Stalinist Disneyland on acid where everyone you meet smiles but the far-off fields are filled with elderly laborers snipping individual blades of grass with scissors. Surprisingly, they let me film and photograph everything but soldiers. There have been plenty of excellent NK documentaries that focus on the country's history or try to pull back the curtain on what's really going on, so I chose to focus solely on what was presented, ie the relentless stream of hyper-positive propaganda.

They presented me with a DVD that recently came into their possession and asked me to translate it. They also asked me to post the completed film on the Internet so that it could reach a worldwide audience. I believed what I was told and an agreement was made to protect their identities (and mine). Despite my concerns about what I was viewing when I returned home, I proceeded to translate and post the film on You Tube because of the film's extraordinary content. I have now made public my belief that this film was never intended for a domestic audience in the DPRK. Instead, I believe that these people, who presented themselves as 'defectors' specifically targeted me because of my reputation as a translator and interpreter. Furthermore, I now believe these people work for the DPRK. The fact that I have continued to translate and post the film in spite of this belief does not make me complicit in their intention to spread their ideology. I chose to keep posting this film because - regardless of who made it - I believe people should see it because of the issues it raises and I stand by my right to post it for people to share and discuss freely with each other.

The film is about a former US Army soldier, James J. Dresnok, who defected to North Korea on August 15, 1962. The film was directed and produced by British filmmakers Daniel Gordon and Nicholas Bonner, and was shown at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. The film, which was narrated by actor Christian Slater, was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the festival. The film was first screened in 2007 on the BBC. The film centred around Dresnok's history, highlighting his unhappiness in America, and particularly his desertion from the United States Army in 1962 to the DPRK. It also showed Dresnok in the present day in Pyongyang (where he now lives), interacting with his North Korean family and friends. Dresnok spoke exclusively to the filmmakers about his childhood, his desertion, his life in a country completely foreign and quite hostile to his own, his fellow defectors, and his wife and children. Dresnok is also shown with fellow defectors, including Charles Robert Jenkins, who returned to Japan to be with his wife, Hitomi Soga (a victim of kidnap by the North Koreans), while filming was taking place. Dresnok felt hurt by Jenkins' allegations of physical abuse by Dresnok and the North Korean regime and angrily denied them <b>...</b>"], ["duration", "01:30:29"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/uv3yKGrKtB0?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv3yKGrKtB0&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/uv3yKGrKtB0/default.jpg"], ["title", "Crossing The Line (Dresnok in North Korea) (2007)"], ["updated_at", Wed, 17 Oct 2012 17:43:18 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "uv3yKGrKtB0"]]

For sixty years, North Koreans have been governed by a totalitarian regime. A cult of personality surrounds its three recent leaders: first, Kim Il Sung, secondly his son, Kim Jong Il and currently his son, Kim Jong Un. For Kim Jong Il's 46th birthday, a hybrid begonia named kimjongilia was created, symbolizing wisdom, love, justice, and peace. The film draws its name from this bright red flower and reveals the extraordinary stories told by survivors of North Korea's vast prison camps, of deadly famine, and of every kind of repression. In a series of devastating interviews with refugees, director NC Helkin traces their torturous paths to freedom, on rickety sailboats and across mountain passes, while exposing the inhuman conditions they suffered in the nation's concentration camps. Their experiences are interspersed with archival footage of North Korean propaganda films and original scenes that illuminate the contours of daily life for a people whose every action is monitored, and whose every thought could bring official retribution. Along with the survivors' stories, Kimjongilia examines the mass illusion possible under totalitarianism and the human rights abuses required to maintain that illusion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AID AGENCIES DONATIONS: Aid Agencies that have an active role in the DPRK (North Korea) are and not <b>...</b>"], ["duration", "01:14:07"], ["embedcode", "http://www.youtube.com/v/Y9zgjyd7hgY?version=3&f=videos&d=ASfU7UaVmS185GXdQoHbdJUO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata"], ["is_complete", nil], ["keywords", []], ["linkurl", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9zgjyd7hgY&feature=youtube_gdata"], ["provider", "youtube"], ["thumbnail_url", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9zgjyd7hgY/default.jpg"], ["title", "KIMJONGILIA: North Korea Prison Camps Documentary (COMPLETE)"], ["updated_at", Wed, 17 Oct 2012 17:43:18 UTC +00:00], ["views", nil], ["yt_video_id", "Y9zgjyd7hgY"]]
